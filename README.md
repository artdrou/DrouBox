# 🎶 DrouBox Multi Effects Pedal

A project for learning C++ and embedded software via design and/or implementation of different effects.

## 📖 About

This project is born from the build of a guitar pedal based on the design of **GuitarML** using **Daisy seed** microcontroller, 
and of my will to learn more about C++ audio programmation and embedded dsp.

This is still WIP but feel free to download what can be usefull for you.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

I’d like to extend a big thank you to **GuitarML**, the creator of **[FunBox](https://github.com/GuitarML/FunBox)**  a stereo guitar pedal platform powered by Daisy Seed. FunBox inspired several design elements in this project, particularly in layout and visual styling.
FunBox is an open-source project featuring KiCad PCB design files and software for building a fully configurable guitar effects pedal! You can check out their repository for design inspiration.
